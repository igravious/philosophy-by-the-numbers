  abstract = {In this book Lev Manovich offers the first systematic and rigorous theory of new media. He places new media within the histories of visual and media cultures of the last few centuries. He discusses new media's reliance on conventions of old media, such as the rectangular frame and mobile camera, and shows how new media works create the illusion of reality, address the viewer, and represent space. He also analyzes categories and forms unique to new media, such as interface and database.Manovich uses concepts from film theory, art history, literary theory, and computer science and also develops new theoretical constructs, such as cultural interface, spatial montage, and cinegratography. The theory and history of cinema play a particularly important role in the book. Among other topics, Manovich discusses parallels between the histories of cinema and of new media, digital cinema, screen and montage in cinema and in new media, and historical ties between avant-garde film and new media. 0},

  abstract = {A type system is a syntactic method for automatically checking the absence of certain erroneous behaviors by classifying program phrases according to the kinds of values they compute. The study of type systems -- and of programming languages from a type-theoretic perspective -- has important applications in software engineering, language design, high-performance compilers, and security.This text provides a comprehensive introduction both to type systems in computer science and to the basic theory of programming languages. The approach is pragmatic and operational; each new concept is motivated by programming examples and the more theoretical sections are driven by the needs of implementations. Each chapter is accompanied by numerous exercises and solutions, as well as a running implementation, available via the Web. Dependencies between chapters are explicitly identified, allowing readers to choose a variety of paths through the material.The core topics include the untyped lambda-calculus, simple type systems, type reconstruction, universal and existential polymorphism, subtyping, bounded quantification, recursive types, kinds, and type operators. Extended case studies develop a variety of approaches to modeling the features of object-oriented languages.},

  shorttitle = {Logicomix},
  abstract = {This brilliantly illustrated tale of reason, insanity, love and truth  recounts the story of Bertrand Russell's life. Raised by his paternal  grandparents, young Russell was never told the whereabouts of his  parents. Driven by a desire for knowledge of his own history, he  attempted to force the world to yield to his yearnings: for truth,  clarity and resolve. As he grew older, and increasingly sophisticated as a philosopher and  mathematician, Russell strove to create an objective language with  which to describe the world - one free of the biases and slippages of  the written word. At the same time, he began courting his first wife,  teasing her with riddles and leaning on her during the darker days,  when his quest was bogged down by paradoxes, frustrations and the  ghosts of his family's secrets. Ultimately, he found considerable  success - but his career was stalled when he was outmatched by an  intellectual rival: his young, strident, brilliantly original student,  Ludwig Wittgenstein. An insightful and complexly layered narrative, Logicomix  reveals both Russell's inner struggle and the quest for the foundations  of logic. Narration by an older, wiser Russell, as well as asides from  the author himself, make sense of the story's heady and powerful ideas.  At its heart, Logicomix is a story about the conflict between pure  reason and the persistent flaws of reality, a narrative populated by  great and august thinkers, young lovers, ghosts and insanity.},

  abstract = {In the domain of ontology design as well as in Conceptual Modeling, representing universals is a challenging problem. Most approaches which have addressed this problem rely either on Description Logics (DLs) or on First Order Logic (FOL), but many difficulties remain especially about expressiveness. In mathematical logic and program checking, type theories have proved to be appealing but so far, they have not been applied in the formalization of ontologies. To bridge this gap, we present here the main capabilities of a theory for representing ontological structures in a dependently-typed framework which relies both on a constructive logic and on a functional type system. The usability of the theory is demonstrated with the Coq language which defines in a precise way what ontological primitives such as classes, relations, properties and meta-properties, are in terms of type classes.},

  abstract = {In The Unity of Content and Form in Philosophical Writing, Jon Stewart argues that there is a close relation between content and form in philosophical writing. While this might seem obvious at first glance, it is overlooked in the current climate of Anglophone academic philosophy, which, Stewart contends, accepts only a single genre as proper for philosophical expression. Stewart demonstrates the uniformity of today's philosophical writing by contrasting it with that of the past.  Taking specific texts from the history of philosophy and literature as case studies, Stewart shows how the use of genres like dialogues, plays and short stories were an entirely suitable and effective means of presenting and arguing for philosophical positions given the concrete historical and cultural contexts in which they appeared.  Now, Stewart argues, the prevailing intolerance means that the same texts are dismissed as unphilosophical merely due to their form, although their content is, in fact, profoundly philosophical. The book's challenge to current conventions of philosophical is provocative and timely, and will be of great interest to students and scholars of philosophy, literature and history.},

  title = {The {{Hilbert-Brouwer}} controversy resolved?},
  abstract = {Since this lecture is called the Beth lecture, It is natural to ask oneself what connection is there between Beth and intuitionism? and, to my mind, the most obvious answer is: the Beth models for intuitionistic propositional and predicate logic. I would like to remind you of a certain picture that we all use when thinking in terms of possible worlds, namely the picture in which we are always at a certain stage, considering a number of possible future alternatives, and then one of those alternatives is realized and we get to a new stage, at which we are faced with some other alternatives, one of those alternatives materializes, and then the whole process continues in the same way. That means that, at each moment, we are at the end of a certain path, which I will draw by a thick line, symbolizing that which has already materialized, and we are considering all possible future alternatives, one of those alternatives materializes, as a result of which the thick path gets extended, and then the pattern repeats itself: We all think in terms of this picture: it underlies possible world semantics, and it is natural to ask: where does it really come from? I mean: who had this picture for the first time? Most of us have probably met it in connection with Kripke semantics (Kripke 1965), but actually Kripke semantics was predated by Beth semantics by a couple of years: Beth’ papers were published in 1956 and 1959 (Beth 1956a, 1959), and Beth in turn drew on Brouwer here, because he took the nodes, or stages, to form a spread in Brouwer’s sense (Brouwer 1918B).},

She looks at the history and philosophy of formal languages, and focuses on the cognitive impact of formal languages on human reasoning, drawing on their historical development, psychology, cognitive science, and philosophy"--},

  abstract = {The human brain has some capabilities that the brains of other animals lack. It is to these distinctive capabilities that our species owes its dominant position. Other animals have stronger muscles or sharper claws, but we have cleverer brains.  If machine brains one day come to surpass human brains in general intelligence, then this new superintelligence could become very powerful. As the fate of the gorillas now depends more on us humans than on the gorillas themselves, so the fate of our species then would come to depend on the actions of the machine superintelligence.  But we have one advantage: we get to make the first move. Will it be possible to construct a seed AI or otherwise to engineer initial conditions so as to make an intelligence explosion survivable? How could one achieve a controlled detonation?  To get closer to an answer to this question, we must make our way through a fascinating landscape of topics and considerations. Read the book and learn about oracles, genies, singletons; about boxing methods, tripwires, and mind crime; about humanity's cosmic endowment and differential technological development; indirect normativity, instrumental convergence, whole brain emulation and technology couplings; Malthusian economics and dystopian evolution; artificial intelligence, and biological cognitive enhancement, and collective intelligence.  This profoundly ambitious and original book picks its way carefully through a vast tract of forbiddingly difficult intellectual terrain. Yet the writing is so lucid that it somehow makes it all seem easy. After an utterly engrossing journey that takes us to the frontiers of thinking about the human condition and the future of intelligent life, we find in Nick Bostrom's work nothing less than a reconceptualization of the essential task of our time.},

Luciano Floridi, one of the leading figures in contemporary philosophy, argues that the explosive developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is changing the answer to these fundamental human questions.  As the boundaries between life online and offline break down, and we become seamlessly connected to each other and surrounded by smart, responsive objects, we are all becoming integrated into an "infosphere". Personas we adopt in social media, for example, feed into our 'real' lives so that we begin to live, as Floridi puts in, "onlife". Following those led by Copernicus, Darwin, and Freud, this metaphysical shift represents nothing less than a fourth revolution.  "Onlife" defines more and more of our daily activity - the way we shop, work, learn, care for our health, entertain ourselves, conduct our relationships; the way we interact with the worlds of law, finance, and politics; even the way we conduct war. In every department of life, ICTs have become environmental forces which are creating and transforming our realities. How can we ensure that we shall reap their benefits? What are the implicit risks? Are our technologies going to enable and empower us, or constrain us? Floridi argues that we must expand our ecological and ethical approach to cover both natural and man-made realities, putting the 'e' in an environmentalism that can deal successfully with the new challenges posed by our digital technologies and information society.},

  abstract = {It is the aim of INDICES to document recent explorations in the various fields of philosophical logic and formal linguistics and their applications in other disciplines. The main emphasis of this series is on self-contained monographs covering particular areas of recent research and surveys of methods, problems, and results in all fields of inquiry where recourse to logical analysis and logical methods has been fruitful. INDICES will contain monographs dealing with the central areas of philosophical logic (extensional and intensional systems, indexical logics, non-classical logics, philosophy of logic, etc.) as well as studies in which these systems are applied to specific issues in philosophy, in the formal semantics of natural languages, the foundations of linguistic theory, in computational linguistics, and in theoretical computer science. Constructive type theory was first presented in 1970, by the Swedish logician Per Martin-Lof. It has become one of the main approaches used in the foundations of mathematics and computer science. But it has remained relatively unknown among linguists and philosophers, although it provides a considerable extension of the concepts and techniques of logic. The book first gives an introduction to type theory from the point of view of linguistics and the philosophy of language. Type theory is then applied in the areas of quantification, anaphora, temporal reference, and the structure of text and discourse. By virtue of the type-theoretical concepts of proof object and context, various phenomena of dependence and progression in language can be discussed in precise terms, and several well-known problems can be solved. A categorial grammar is presented togenerate formally a fragment of English, together with an example of a computer implementation.},

Socrates reveals it to be a kind of divine madness that can allow our souls to growwings and soar to their greatest heights. Then the conversation changes direction and turns to a discussion of rhetoric, which must be based on truth passionately sought, thus allying it to philosophy. The dialogue closes by denigrating the value of the written word in any context, compared to theliving teaching of a Socratic philosopher.The shifts of topic and register have given rise to doubts about the unity of the dialogue, doubts which are addressed in the introduction to this volume. Full explanatory notes also elucidate issues throughout the dialogue that might puzzle a modern reader.},
