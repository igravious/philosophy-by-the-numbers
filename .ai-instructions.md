This document provides an analysis of the CorpusBuilder Ruby on Rails project.

## AI Assistant Instructions

### Communication with User

Always keep the user informed of actions taken, such as running terminal commands, editing files, or performing analyses. Provide clear explanations of what you're doing and why.

### AI Workspace Organization

**Documentation Directory Structure:**
- **`docs/`** - User-created or doc-tool-generated documentation (permanent reference material)
- **`docs/ai/`** - AI-generated markdown documentation (long-term AI analysis and guides)
- **`docs/wip/`** - AI work-in-progress files (scratchpads, todo lists, temporary notes)

**AI Workspace Rules:**
- The most recent markdown file in `docs/wip/` is always my current todo-list/scratchpad
- Generate suitably named todo files in `docs/wip/` as needed for ongoing work
- Place completed AI documentation in `docs/ai/` for permanent reference
- Never place AI scratchpad/WIP files in the main `docs/` directory

### Command Execution Preferences

**Always prefer the `bin/` versions of commands in this Rails project:**

- Use `bin/rake` instead of `rake` or `bundle exec rake`
- Use `bin/rails` instead of `rails` or `bundle exec rails`
- The bin/ directory contains binstubs that handle proper executable context automatically

**Rails Server Management:**
- **Check if server is running first:** Before starting `bin/rails server`, check if it's already running to avoid conflicts
- **Check command:** `ps aux | grep rails` or `lsof -i :3000` (default Rails port)
- **Only start if not running:** If server is already running, you don't need to launch it again

Example commands:
```bash
bin/rake test TEST=test/models/philosopher_test.rb TESTOPTS="-v"
```

**Check server status before starting:**
```bash
ps aux | grep rails
```

### Ruby 2.6.10 + Rails 4.2 Threading Issues

**IMPORTANT:** This project uses Ruby 2.6.10 with Rails 4.2.11.3, which has a known Monitor threading incompatibility that causes `ThreadError: already initialized` in ActionController::TestCase.

**Resolution Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** - Automatic workaround implemented

**Workaround Files:**
- `config/initializers/ruby_2_6_monitor_fix.rb` - Monitor class monkey patch
- `test/support/thread_error_workarounds.rb` - Alternative testing methods

**What was implemented:**
- Monitor reinitialization protection to prevent ThreadError
- Alternative `safe_controller_get()` method for testing controllers
- Automatic fallback Response creation that bypasses Monitor issues

**Result:** All tests now pass without ThreadError. No manual intervention needed.

## Application Architecture

### Data Model

The application's data model is complex and centered around a `shadows` table that uses Single Table Inheritance (STI) to store information about both philosophers and works. This table is very wide and contains a wealth of metadata from various sources, including DBpedia, VIAF, and several online encyclopedias.

Other key tables include:

*   `texts`: Represents the actual texts in the corpus.
*   `authors`: Represents the authors of the texts.
*   `dictionaries` and `units`: For lexical analysis of the texts.
*   `tags`, `labelings`, `filters`, `meta_filters`: A flexible system for classifying and organizing the texts.
*   `fyles`: Stores metadata about the files on disk.
*   `links`, `properties`, `p_smarts`: Tables for integrating with Semantic Web and Linked Data sources.

### Data Model Details

**Single Table Inheritance (STI) - The Shadow Model:**
- **Base class**: `Shadow` (in `shadows` table with 100+ columns)
- **Subclasses**: `Philosopher` and `Work`
- Contains metadata from DBpedia, VIAF, Wikidata, and multiple encyclopedias
- Key methods: `#english`, `#year`, `#show_label` for multi-language support

**Core Model Relationships:**
- `Philosopher` (Shadow subclass) → has_many `Work` (Shadow subclass)
- `Work` → has_many `Text` (actual corpus content)
- `Shadow` → has_many `Name` (multi-language labels)
- `Text` → belongs_to `Author` (distinct from Philosopher)
- `Fyle` → file metadata with caching system for corpus documents

**Classification & Metadata:**
- `Tag`, `Labeling`, `Filter`, `MetaFilter` → flexible tagging system
- `CanonicityWeights` → configurable algorithm weights (no hardcoded values)
- `MetricSnapshot` → complete audit trail for all metric calculations

**Semantic Web Integration:**
- `Link`, `Property`, `P::Smart` → RDF/Linked Data connections
- SPARQL client integration for Wikidata and DBpedia queries

**Key Modules:**
- `DateTimeMethods` (concern) → date parsing utilities
- `SecurityConfig` (`app/lib/security_config.rb`) → centralized security validation

### Routes

```bash
bin/rake routes
```

The application's routes are a mix of standard RESTful resources and custom routes for specific pages and actions. The routes reveal a sophisticated interface for querying the corpus, with dedicated pages for asking questions about various aspects of the data.

## Key Features

*   **Corpus Management:** The application provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing a corpus of philosophical texts, including adding, editing, and deleting philosophers, works, texts, and authors.
*   **Data Integration:** The application integrates with external data sources like DBpedia and VIAF to enrich the corpus with additional metadata.
*   **Semantic Web/Linked Data:** The application uses Semantic Web technologies to represent and query the data.
*   **Powerful Querying:** The application provides a sophisticated interface for querying the corpus, allowing users to ask complex questions about the data.
*   **File Management:** The application has a robust system for managing the files that make up the corpus, including caching, versioning, and health checking.

## Considerations

*   **Rails Version:** The application is built on Rails 4.2.
*   **Frontend:** The application uses Bower for frontend package management. Bower was created by Twitter and became popular in the Rails community through Bootstrap adoption. This project likely adopted Bower due to Bootstrap usage and its flat dependency structure (avoiding multiple versions of libraries like jQuery on the same page).
*   **Complex Schema:** The database schema is complex and, in some cases, unconventional. This could make it difficult for new developers to understand and work with the application.

### Common Development Tasks

```bash
# Database operations
bin/rake db:migrate               # Run pending migrations

```

### Testing Philosophy
This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Always add tests first before implementing new features or making changes. This ensures code quality and prevents regressions when modifying complex systems like the canonicity metrics calculation.

### Coding Philosophy
Follow the **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principle. When you find yourself writing similar code in multiple places, refactor it into a shared module, method, or configuration file. Examples in this codebase:
- Warning suppression logic centralized in `config/suppress_warnings.rb` and used by all bin scripts
- Canonicity calculation logic extracted into `Philosopher#calculate_canonicity_measure` method
- Shared progress bar and error handling patterns in rake tasks

### Canonicity Algorithm Implementation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

- **Algorithm**: Linear Weighted Combination with normalized importance weights
- **Configuration**: Stored in `canonicity_weights` table (no hardcoded constants)
- **Auditing**: Each `MetricSnapshot` records exact weights configuration used
- **Rake Tasks**: Refactored to use database configuration and write to snapshots (not override records)
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with isolated approach (avoids 13K+ record iteration)
- **Documentation**: Complete documentation in `/docs/` directory

### Security Implementation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - All vulnerabilities fixed and tested

**Security Fixes Implemented:**
- **SQL Injection**: Method whitelisting in QuestionsController#specific
- **Code Injection**: SecurityConfig validation for dynamic method calls
- **Path Traversal**: File ID validation in DictionariesController  
- **Hardcoded Credentials**: Environment variables in Philosoraptor module
- **Exception Handling**: Specific exception types with proper logging

**Security Infrastructure:**
- **SecurityConfig Module** (`app/lib/security_config.rb`) - Centralized security validation
- **Environment Template** (`.env.template`) - Secure credential configuration
- **Core Extensions** (`config/initializers/core_extensions.rb`) - Proper loading order

**Testing:** 21 security assertions - ALL PASSING with isolation testing approach

### Delta-of-Deltas Text Convergence Analysis

**Purpose:** Detect convergence patterns in philosophical texts by analyzing how similarities evolve as corpus grows.

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Implemented with Saffron-OS integration

**Three-Phase Pipeline:**

**Phase 1: Progressive Corpus Runs** (`delta_phases:saffron_runs`)
- Generates progressively larger corpus snapshots
- Creates Saffron-OS analysis for each snapshot size
- Supports canonicity-based work selection
- Output: `delta_of_deltas/{base_dir}/saffron_run_{n}/`

**Phase 2: Delta Calculation** (`delta_phases:calculate_deltas`)
- Compares adjacent Saffron results to compute deltas
- Supports multiple diff strategies (euclidean, cosine, manhattan, etc.)
- Output: `delta_of_deltas/{base_dir}/deltas/`

**Phase 3: Delta-of-Deltas** (`delta_phases:delta_of_deltas`)
- Analyzes how deltas change over corpus size
- Detects convergence when delta-of-deltas falls below threshold
- Output: `delta_of_deltas/{base_dir}/delta_of_deltas/`

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Run complete analysis on high-canonicity works
bin/rake delta_analysis:process_works

# Or run phases individually
bin/rake delta_phases:saffron_runs[10,0.5,my_analysis]
bin/rake delta_phases:calculate_deltas[my_analysis,euclidean]
bin/rake delta_phases:delta_of_deltas[my_analysis,0.1]
```

**Documentation**: See `docs/DELTA_OF_DELTAS_ALGORITHM.md` for complete mathematical and implementation details.

### Asset Pipeline & Bower Integration

The application uses Bower for frontend dependency management, integrated with the Rails asset pipeline.

**Bower Configuration:**
- `bower.json` → defines dependencies (d3, picnic, milligram, etc.)
- `.bowerrc` → configures installation to `vendor/assets/bower_components/`
- Run `bower install` to download packages

**Asset Pipeline Search Order:**
1. `app/assets/stylesheets` (application-specific styles)
2. `lib/assets/stylesheets` (local libraries)
3. `vendor/assets/stylesheets` (third-party & bower components)

**Key Workflow:**
```bash
# Add dependencies to bower.json
bower install

# Fix relative path issues in bower CSS (converts url() to asset_path helpers)
bin/rake resolve:paths

# Restart Rails server to pick up new assets
bin/rails server
```

**Integration Points:**
- `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` → includes stylesheets via `stylesheet_link_tag`
- `app/assets/stylesheets/application.css` → manifest with `*= require` directives
- `vendor/assets/stylesheets/bower-sprockets.scss` → custom shim for complex components

See README.rdoc "Asset Pipeline & Bower Integration" for detailed documentation.

### SQLite Boolean Handling (Rails 4.2 Gotcha)

**Issue**: Rails 4.2 with SQLite has inconsistent boolean representation:
- **ActiveRecord methods** (`.create!`, `.update_all`) → Store as `'t'`/`'f'` (text)
- **Raw SQL** (`execute`) → Store as `1`/`0` (integer)
- **Query behavior**: `Model.where(field: true)` generates SQL `field = 't'`, which fails to match integer `1`

**Solution**: Always use ActiveRecord methods in migrations and model code. Avoid raw SQL for boolean operations.

**Documentation**: See `docs/SQLITE_BOOLEAN_HANDLING.md` for detailed explanation and migration examples.

**Vigilance Note**: This gotcha can silently break queries when mixing SQL approaches in this codebase. Always double-check boolean field queries when debugging unexpected "no results" issues.

### Legacy Table Removal (2025-10-10)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Obsolete tables removed from schema

**Tables Removed:**
- **`actual_texts`** - Superseded by `fyles` table (June 2015)
  - Original purpose: Web-scraped external text sources with extraction parameters
  - Had only 2 legacy rows at time of removal
  - Replaced by `fyles` which provides comprehensive file metadata and caching

- **`author_texts`** - Superseded by `writings` table (June 2015)
  - Original purpose: Simple author-text join table
  - Was completely empty (0 rows) at time of removal
  - Replaced by `writings` which adds role support (Author/Translator/Editor)

**Migration**: `db/migrate/20251010144126_drop_legacy_tables.rb`

**Documentation Updates:**
- `app/ERD.md` - Removed table descriptions and relationship references
- `app/helpers/pages_helper.rb` - Removed table_description entries

**Context:** These tables were created in early development (June 2015) but were immediately superseded by better-designed replacements. They remained in the schema for nearly 10 years as harmless artifacts but have now been removed to simplify the data model.

### Memcached for Performance

**Purpose**: Memcached caches expensive database queries to dramatically speed up encyclopedia flag population.

**Critical Use Case:** The `import/sauce.rb` script processes 3,000+ encyclopedia entries, each triggering 1-2 name-matching queries against the `names` table (13,329 philosophers × multi-language labels). Without caching, this means **6,000+ database queries with expensive LIKE operations** per encyclopedia source.

**Performance Impact:**
- **Without Memcached:** Each run takes 5-10+ minutes
- **With Memcached:** First run ~90 seconds, subsequent runs ~6 seconds (90%+ cache hit rate)

**What Gets Cached:**
- `Name.exact_label_count(name)` - exact philosopher name matches
- `Name.rough_label_count(name)` - fuzzy LIKE matches
- Cache keys: `"EC,#{name}"` and `"LC,#{name}"`

**Running Memcached:**
```bash
# Check if running
ps aux | grep memcache

# Start if not running (usually auto-starts on Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo systemctl start memcached
sudo systemctl enable memcached  # Auto-start on boot
```

**Graceful Degradation:** All Memcached operations have error handling (as of 2025-10-10). The application works without Memcached, just slower.

**Files with Memcached Integration:**
- `app/models/name.rb` - Name matching queries with caching
- `lib/knowledge.rb` - Wikidata/DBpedia queries
- `lib/knowledge/wikipedia.rb` - Wikipedia API calls
- `lib/knowledge/dbpedia.rb` - DBpedia SPARQL queries

See `docs/ENCYCLOPEDIA_FLAGS.md` for the complete flag population workflow.

### Reference Work Flag Population Workflow

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - Workflow documented and bugs fixed (2025-10-10)

**Master Script:** `import/sauce.rb` - Universal encyclopedia flag setter for all 9 sources

**Quick Reference:**
```bash
# Populate encyclopedia flags (requires scraped *_tweak.txt files in import/)
bin/rails runner import/sauce.rb ox_2nd      # Oxford Dictionary 2nd ed
bin/rails runner import/sauce.rb ox_3rd      # Oxford Dictionary 3rd ed
bin/rails runner import/sauce.rb stanford    # Stanford Encyclopedia
bin/rails runner import/sauce.rb cambridge   # Cambridge Dictionary
bin/rails runner import/sauce.rb routledge   # Routledge Encyclopedia
bin/rails runner import/sauce.rb internet    # Internet Encyclopedia (IEP)
bin/rails runner import/sauce.rb kemerling   # Philosophy Pages
bin/rails runner import/sauce.rb borchert    # Macmillan Reference
bin/rails runner import/sauce.rb runes       # Runes Dictionary
```

**How It Works:**
1. Reads scraped philosopher names from `*_tweak.txt` files
2. Matches names to `Philosopher` records via `Name` table (exact + fuzzy matching)
3. Validates matches using birth/death dates (±5 years non-circa, ±10 circa)
4. Falls back to manual Q-ID mappings from `import/q_name.rb`
5. Sets boolean flag on matched philosophers (e.g., `philosopher.stanford = true`)

**Directory Structure:**
- `import/www.*.com/*_tweak.txt` - Scraped philosopher lists (NOT in git - copyrighted)
- `import/q_name.rb` - Manual Q-ID mappings for ambiguous cases
- `_txt/2017/*.txt` - Historical diff files showing edition changes

**Performance:** With Memcached running, processes 3,000+ entries in under 2 minutes.

**Documentation**: See `docs/REFERENCE_WORK_FLAGS.md` for complete technical details, troubleshooting, and the matching algorithm.
- correction, for managing philosophical works and figures, "encyclopedia scraping" should read "reference work index and metadata leveraging" :)
