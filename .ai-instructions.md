*   **thor** - Toolkit for building powerful command-line interfaces

## Application Architecture

### Data Model

The application's data model is complex and centered around a `shadows` table that uses Single Table Inheritance (STI) to store information about both philosophers and works. This table is very wide and contains a wealth of metadata from various sources, including DBpedia, VIAF, and several online encyclopedias.

Other key tables include:

*   `texts`: Represents the actual texts in the corpus.
*   `authors`: Represents the authors of the texts.
*   `dictionaries` and `units`: For lexical analysis of the texts.
*   `tags`, `labelings`, `filters`, `meta_filters`: A flexible system for classifying and organizing the texts.
*   `fyles`: Stores metadata about the files on disk.
*   `links`, `properties`, `p_smarts`: Tables for integrating with Semantic Web and Linked Data sources.

### Routes

The application's routes are a mix of standard RESTful resources and custom routes for specific pages and actions. The routes reveal a sophisticated interface for querying the corpus, with dedicated pages for asking questions about various aspects of the data.

## Key Features

*   **Corpus Management:** The application provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing a corpus of philosophical texts, including adding, editing, and deleting philosophers, works, texts, and authors.
*   **Data Integration:** The application integrates with external data sources like DBpedia and VIAF to enrich the corpus with additional metadata.
*   **Semantic Web/Linked Data:** The application uses Semantic Web technologies to represent and query the data.
*   **Powerful Querying:** The application provides a sophisticated interface for querying the corpus, allowing users to ask complex questions about the data.
*   **File Management:** The application has a robust system for managing the files that make up the corpus, including caching, versioning, and health checking.

## Considerations

*   **Rails Version:** The application is built on Rails 4.2.
*   **Frontend:** The application uses Bower for frontend package management.
*   **Complex Schema:** The database schema is complex and, in some cases, unconventional. This could make it difficult for new developers to understand and work with the application.

## Conclusion

CorpusBuilder is a powerful and feature-rich application for building and managing a corpus of philosophical texts. Its strengths are its rich data model, its powerful querying capabilities, and its integration with external data sources. However, its use of an outdated version of Rails and its complex database schema are significant considerations for any future development or maintenance.
